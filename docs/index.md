Hello world! I welcome you to my world. Let me introduce myself and begin with my name.
I am **Anirudh Verma**. My world begins with me and ends with me as my name does it with letter 'a'. So, in my world you all are just visiters in which only some special and few peoples are allowed to feel my vibes. For rest, it has "Do Not Touch" board. So, carefully step in and step out in my world and have a safe and happy journey at your own risk.
## Brief about me
I am a person with an attitude of being _**UNSTOPPABLE**_ as my name even suggests that. Currently, I am a student in Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) Ludhiana, Punjab. And I am pursuing B.Tech Course in Mechanical Engineering. I live in Chengalpattu district of TamilNadu but I basically belong to Haryana. Interestingly, my birthplace is Chennai. And I opened my eyes for the first time, in the year 2003. Date and month can be easily guessed by all of you as I share it with **Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi**.  
####Qualification

I have done my schooling from Atomic Energy Central School (AECS-1) Kalpakkam (from 1st to 3rd standard) and AECS Anupuram (from 4th to 12th standard). I have secured 93% in 10th std and 95.2% in 10+2 CBSE board.















## Hobbies and Interests
My hobbies and interests are not much but exists. I like playing Badminton, but I am not able to play it during lockdown but it has a place in my heart and when I will get a chance, I will just grab it like anything. I am also interested in writing poetry when in humour. And I generally write sonnets (a poem of 14 lines). I am fitness addicted too so, I feel a day incomplete without workout. I am also interested in programming as I have learnt `Python` and in the process of learning `C`
. I also like listening songs & watching movies without popcorn and drinks as I am very health conscious. I also like playing story based games such as Witcher 3, Assassin's Creed Odyssey etc.
